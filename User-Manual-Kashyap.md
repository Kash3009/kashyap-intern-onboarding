# User Manual — Kashyap

## About Me

I’m someone who genuinely enjoys learning, improving, and being part of a team that’s building something meaningful. I take pride in doing good work, showing initiative, and supporting the people I collaborate with. 
I’m curious, driven, and I like solving problems with a calm, thoughtful approach.

## How I Work Best

I do my best work when expectations are clear and there’s shared alignment on priorities. Once I understand the goal and context, I work independently and deliver reliably. 
I’m proactive about asking questions when something is unclear and I value open communication.
I enjoy working in focused blocks and tend to enter deep concentration when I'm analyzing information, planning, or making product decisions.

## Communication Style

I appreciate communication that is direct, encouraging, and clear. Bullet points, structure, or examples help me process information faster. 
I’m happy with async messages for most things, but I also appreciate quick calls when fast clarification is needed.
I aim to respond promptly, with clarity and respect.

## Feedback Preferences

I value honest, specific feedback. I don’t view feedback as criticism — I see it as coaching and a chance to get better. 
If something can be improved, I’d rather know early so I can adjust quickly and move forward with confidence.
Written feedback is great because I like revisiting it, but I’m also comfortable discussing feedback live.
