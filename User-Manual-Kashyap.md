# User Manual for Kashyap

## My Role
Product Management Intern  
Currently working through onboarding tasks, research, feature understanding, and learning internal workflows.

## Availability
I generally work flexible hours, but the best windows to reach me or expect quicker replies are:
- Monday–Friday: mornings to late evenings  
- Weekends: available if needed, but prefer scheduled communication  

---

## How I Work Best
I do my best work when expectations are clear and the goals are well-defined. Once aligned, I’m independent and proactive — I don’t need constant check-ins, but I appreciate clarity at the start.

I enjoy structured workflows, thoughtful planning, and knowing the *why* behind a task. Deep focus time helps me do my best work.

I struggle when tasks are vague with no clarity on expectations or outcomes. If something feels unclear, I’ll ask questions rather than guess.

---

## Communication Style
- I prefer messages that are clear, purposeful, and to the point.
- Written communication works well for me, especially when there are multiple steps.
- I’m happy to jump on a short call if something requires fast alignment.
- Tone matters — I appreciate calm, respectful communication.

**Best way to reach me:** Discord or direct message.  
**If urgent:** Tag me and send a short, clear note on what’s needed.

## Collaboration & Teamwork
I work best in a team where communication is honest, respectful, and direct.  
I value supportive environments where questions are normal and feedback is constructive.

My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is unclear ownership or long back-and-forth messages that could’ve been a simple short call.

If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I’m processing the information, I’ll speak when I have something meaningful to add.

---

## Focus & Productivity
I stay focused by working in blocks and limiting distractions.  
Things like music, timers, and task lists help me stay consistent.

Things that distract me are frequent interruptions or rapidly changing priorities without context.

The best way to support my productivity is to give me clarity on priorities and outcomes, I’ll take care of the rest.

---

## Feedback & Growth
I prefer feedback that is:
- Specific  
- Actionable  
- Constructive  
- Delivered respectfully  

You don’t need to sugarcoat things, honesty helps me grow faster. If I make a mistake, let me know directly and early so I can fix it.

I appreciate when teammates give context, examples, or suggestions, it helps me improve and learn faster.

## Fun Facts & Quirks
One thing people often misunderstand is that if I’m quiet, I’m not disengaged I’m thinking.

A fun fact about me: I'm always learning something new, whether it's about product, design, psychology, or strategy.

**My work superpower:**  
I’m calm under pressure, curious, and always willing to learn and improve I push myself to deliver quality and become better with every task.
