# Roles in an Agile Team
Agile teams are built around shared ownership and continuous collaboration rather than strict top-down control. Each role contributes from a different angle, but the goal is the same: deliver value to users efficiently and iteratively.

## Research Summary
Agile roles vary depending on the framework, but some core positions appear across most teams.
Developers are responsible for building the product. They turn requirements into working software and collaborate with other roles to ensure functionality, quality, and feasibility.

Quality Assurance (QA) focuses on validating that what has been built works as intended. They identify defects, test functionality, and help ensure user experience and reliability meet expectations.

Product Managers (PMs) prioritise what the team builds and why. They represent the business and user perspective and make decisions about value, scope, and product direction. They help refine requirements and maintain alignment with the product vision.

Agile Project Managers or Scrum Masters support the process rather than the product itself. Their role is to remove blockers, facilitate Agile ceremonies, support team productivity, and protect the team from unnecessary interruptions.

Other supporting roles such as UX designers, stakeholders, and customer support contribute additional insight. UX ensures usability and accessibility. Stakeholders provide strategic guidance. Customer support brings real-world user feedback back into the development cycle.
Collaboration expectations shift depending on whether the team is working in Scrum or Kanban. Scrum focuses on fixed sprint cycles, ceremony structure, and commitments. Kanban is more continuous and flow-based, with fewer meetings and more emphasis on real-time prioritisation.
Regardless of the framework, communication and shared clarity are essential.

## Reflection
My current role aligns closely with product analysis and product management tasks. I contribute by clarifying requirements, supporting prioritisation, and ensuring user and business context remain visible during development. My work helps prevent ambiguity and aligns the team around a shared understanding of objectives.
My responsibilities overlap most with developers and UX roles since feature planning, refinement, and decision-making often require input from both perspectives. Clear communication, documented expectations, and timely feedback are key to avoiding delays or misunderstandings.

## Task Notes
One key role I expect to collaborate with frequently is developers. To improve teamwork with them, I can provide clearer acceptance criteria, anticipate potential questions during refinement, and ensure requirements are specific, testable, and aligned with user needs. This supports smoother implementation and reduces rework.
