# Data Privacy & Confidentiality

## Key Learnings

After reviewing Focus Bear’s privacy approach and general confidentiality expectations, it’s clear that protecting user data is not just a technical requirement—it’s part of maintaining trust. Information such as user insights, feature roadmaps, customer messages, internal discussions, and analytics should all be treated as confidential unless explicitly marked otherwise.
Good security practices start with simple habits: locking devices when unattended, using secure passwords, avoiding public sharing of work files, and keeping access limited to what is needed. Data should only be shared with authorised team members and never stored in personal folders or external platforms without approval.
If a data breach or accidental disclosure occurs, the correct response is to report it immediately rather than trying to fix it quietly. Timely reporting reduces harm and ensures compliance with legal and organisational requirements.

## Reflection

To ensure I handle confidential information correctly, I need to be more intentional about how I store and access files. I sometimes leave tabs open or keep information on devices beyond my work session. Going forward, I’ll make sure I only work from secure, approved applications and avoid downloading unnecessary files.
I also want to pay more attention to how I communicate. It’s easy to forward or screenshot something without thinking, but doing so may put information in the wrong place. Slowing down and checking before sharing will help prevent mistakes.

## Personal Action Plan

- Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication where available
- Store all project-related files only in approved Focus Bear systems
- Avoid sharing screenshots or details of internal work outside controlled channels
- Report any suspicious activity or unintentional exposure immediately
- Use secure networks and avoid working with sensitive data on public Wi-Fi

## Commitments Moving Forward

One habit I will adopt is closing all work tabs and logging out after each session rather than leaving things open. I will also review file-sharing permissions before sharing links, ensuring only the right people have access.

These steps feel minor, but collectively they strengthen privacy and reduce risk.
