# Professionalism at Focus Bear

## Understanding Professionalism in a Casual Work Environment

Professionalism doesn’t just refer to formal clothing, rigid behaviour, or corporate communication. At Focus Bear, professionalism is about how we treat others, how we communicate, and how reliably we work. In a relaxed team culture, the balance comes from being friendly and easygoing while still being respectful, responsive, and accountable.

Examples of professional behaviour include:
- Being clear and concise when messaging teammates
- Showing up on time for meetings or informing others if there's a delay
- Asking questions when unclear instead of making assumptions
- Following through on tasks and communicating progress

Unprofessional behaviour in a casual setting typically involves ignoring messages, reacting defensively to feedback, talking over others, or disrespecting boundaries. Because remote work depends heavily on written communication, tone and intent matter — sarcasm, abrupt replies, or vague comments can easily be misinterpreted.

## Giving and Receiving Feedback

The most effective feedback focuses on the behaviour or outcome — not the person. It should be clear, constructive, and grounded in shared goals rather than emotion. Similarly, receiving feedback involves listening first, avoiding defensive reactions, and asking for clarification if needed.

Assuming good intent helps maintain trust and psychological safety. If something sounds off or unclear, asking questions privately is better than reacting immediately or publicly.

## Reflection

I have seen examples of great teamwork where communication was open, respectful, and direct. What worked well was that everyone felt comfortable asking questions, admitting uncertainty, and sharing ideas without worrying about judgement. This approach made collaboration faster and more enjoyable.

To contribute to that kind of environment, I want to be intentional with how I communicate. This includes checking tone before sending messages, using context when giving updates, and acknowledging others’ work and effort. Preparing for meetings ahead of time — reviewing agenda items, gathering questions, and summarising next steps — will help me stay organised and contribute meaningfully.

Being proactive means taking initiative rather than waiting for someone to tell me what to do. If I need information or decisions from teammates, I’ll follow up respectfully after a reasonable time and escalate only when necessary. Escalation should be the final step, and only when communication attempts have been ignored and the issue impacts work or deadlines.

## Action Taken

I’ve reviewed the expectations and noted the CEO’s contact details as instructed. I will only use it if I encounter serious breaches of conduct, discrimination, or anything that threatens the integrity or safety of the team.

Professionalism at Focus Bear looks like being kind, reliable, curious, and respectful — while still being able to laugh and enjoy the work. That’s the kind of environment I want to help maintain.
