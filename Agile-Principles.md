# Agile Principles and Frameworks
Agile is a flexible approach to building products where teams work in small increments, get feedback early, and adapt based on what they learn. It contrasts with traditional project management styles like Waterfall, where work is planned upfront and changes are difficult once development begins. Agile is built on the idea that priorities shift, users learn while using the product, and teams need room to adjust rather than follow a fixed plan.

## Research Summary

The Agile Manifesto highlights values such as responding to change over following a strict plan, and collaboration over rigid documentation. The principles behind Agile focus on delivering value early, communicating frequently with users and stakeholders, and improving continuously through shorter feedback cycles.
Scrum and Kanban are two common Agile frameworks. Scrum works in structured sprints with defined ceremonies like sprint planning, retrospectives and reviews. Teams commit to a set amount of work for the sprint and deliver at the end. Kanban is less structured and uses a continuous flow model where work moves across stages as capacity becomes available. Instead of sprint commitments, Kanban relies on visualising work and limiting work in progress.
Focus Bear leans towards Kanban because it allows continuous delivery and adaptability without the overhead of sprint ceremonies. Since the product iterates quickly and priorities may shift, Kanban’s flow-based system fits better than time-boxed planning.

## Reflection

The biggest benefit of Agile is how adaptable it is. It allows teams to learn from real usage rather than relying entirely on assumptions made early in a project. This reduces wasted work and supports decisions grounded in evidence. The main challenge is that Agile requires discipline—especially with communication, documentation and prioritisation. Without it, the workflow can become chaotic.
One Agile principle that feels especially useful for my work is “deliver working software frequently.” It encourages progress in small increments rather than waiting for a large, polished final delivery. Applied to my role, this translates to sharing drafts, asking for feedback early, and treating improvement as continuous rather than final.

## Task Summary

Scrum and Kanban both support iterative delivery, but do so differently. Scrum organises work into fixed sprints and uses structured ceremonies to manage collaboration. Kanban uses a continuous model and focuses on workflow visualisation and limiting work in progress. Both can be effective but are chosen based on how often priorities shift and how predictable the work is.
The Agile principle I plan to apply most is consistent incremental delivery. Sharing early versions, refining based on feedback, and avoiding perfectionism upfront will support clearer communication and faster learning.
