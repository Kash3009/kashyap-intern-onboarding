# Learning Goals

## What I Hope to Learn

My main goal in this internship is to understand how real product decisions are made, not just in theory, but in context. I want to learn how feedback, analytics, user behaviour, and company priorities come together to shape features and roadmap direction. 
I’m also looking to get more hands-on with tools used in product workflows, including GitHub boards, PostHog, user feedback channels, and internal documentation.

## Skills I’m Excited to Develop

- Writing clear, concise user stories and requirements
- Prioritising tasks based on impact rather than personal preference
- Analysing user behaviour and converting insights into action
- Contributing to product discussions rather than just completing tasks
- Improving how I communicate asynchronously with a distributed team

## What I Can Contribute

I bring curiosity, consistency, and a willingness to try things rather than overthink. I enjoy breaking down vague ideas into actionable steps and asking questions that clarify assumptions. With my background in business analytics and previous exposure to UX and agile concepts, I can contribute structured thinking, research, and a “user-first” mindset.
I also work well independently, check details carefully, and follow through — which can help lighten workload for the team as I grow more confident.

## An Area I’d Like to Improve

I sometimes overthink before sharing work because I want it to be polished, which can slow collaboration. I want to get better at sharing drafts earlier, asking for feedback sooner, and being more iterative instead of aiming for perfection on the first attempt.

## What Success Looks Like

Success for me means three things:

1. I leave the internship with confidence — knowing I can contribute meaningfully to a product team.
2. I add visible value to Focus Bear, whether through improvements, insights, or completed work that matters.
3. I learn habits, frameworks, and decision-making approaches that make me a stronger product thinker long after the internship ends.

If by the end I can say, *“I made something better — and I grew because of it,”* then that’s success.
