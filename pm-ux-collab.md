## Working with UX Designers at Focus Bear

## Research & Learn

### Role of a PM in UX Design
A Product Manager’s role in UX design is to represent the **user problem, context, and constraints** while supporting designers in crafting intuitive solutions. PMs don’t design screens, but they help ensure designs:
- Solve the right problem
- Align with product goals and priorities
- Consider accessibility and usability from the start
- Are feasible to build within time and technical constraints

The PM acts as a bridge between user needs, business objectives, and design decisions.

### Ensuring Accessibility and Usability
PMs help ensure accessibility and usability by:
- Advocating for simple language and clear hierarchy
- Watching for cognitive overload, especially for neurodivergent users
- Ensuring designs work across screen sizes and devices
- Asking designers to explain the intent behind each interaction
- Validating designs through testing and feedback before development

At Focus Bear, this is especially important given the focus on ADHD and Autistic users, where clarity and predictability directly impact product success.

---

### Giving Constructive UX Feedback
Effective UX feedback from PMs should:
- Focus on the user goal, not personal preference
- Be specific and tied to observed behaviour
- Ask questions instead of dictating solutions
- Balance usability improvements with delivery constraints

Good feedback sounds like:  
“What problem does this interaction solve for the user?” rather than “I don’t like this layout.”

## Task

### UX Review (Based on App & Onboarding Experience)
Based on reviewing the Focus Bear app UI and onboarding flow, two potential areas for improvement stood out:

1. **Header and spacing issues on smaller screens**  
   Some text and UI elements appear truncated or cramped, which can reduce readability and increase cognitive load.

2. **Hidden or partially obscured UI elements**  
   Certain status indicators (such as app health or navigation labels) are not always fully visible, which can confuse first-time users.

---

### Suggested UX Improvement
**Proposed change:**  
Improve layout spacing and ensure all key headers and status indicators are fully visible across common screen sizes.

**Why this improves usability:**  
- Reduces cognitive effort for users
- Improves first-time onboarding clarity
- Builds trust by making the interface feel polished and intentional
- Supports accessibility for users who already struggle with focus or overwhelm

## Reflection

### Impact of UX Decisions on Adoption & Retention
UX decisions directly affect whether users:
- Understand the product quickly
- Feel confident using it
- Stick with it long enough to see value

Even small friction points in onboarding can cause early drop-off, especially for users with attention challenges.

---

### Common UX Mistake PMs Should Watch For
A common mistake is **designing for ideal users instead of real ones** — assuming high attention, perfect context, or unlimited patience. PMs should constantly question whether designs work for users who are tired, distracted, or overwhelmed.

---

### Balancing Design Input and Business Constraints
PMs balance UX and business constraints by:
- Prioritising changes with the highest user impact
- Supporting incremental improvements rather than perfection
- Being transparent about trade-offs
- Ensuring design decisions align with the product’s core mission

Strong PM–UX collaboration leads to better products, faster alignment, and more empathetic design outcomes.

---

## Summary
Working closely with UX designers allows PMs to ensure features are not only functional but genuinely usable and inclusive. At Focus Bear, this collaboration is especially critical given the needs of neurodivergent users. Thoughtful UX decisions, supported by PM advocacy, directly contribute to trust, retention, and long-term product success.
