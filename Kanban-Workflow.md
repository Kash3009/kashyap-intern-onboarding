# Agile Workflows and Kanban
Kanban is an Agile workflow approach focused on visualising work, improving flow, and reducing unnecessary multitasking. Instead of committing to work in fixed sprint cycles, tasks move continuously through stages based on capacity and priority. The main goal is to create steady, predictable progress without overwhelming the team.

## Research Summary
A Kanban board represents work as cards that move through defined stages. The board makes priorities clear and exposes bottlenecks early. Columns typically represent stages such as "To Do," "In Progress," "Blocked," "Review," and "Done." The exact wording may vary between teams, but the purpose remains the same: provide visibility and structure to the workflow.
Tasks move across the board when work progresses. The responsibility for updating the board usually belongs to the person currently handling the task. If something is delayed, missing clarity, or dependent on someone else, the task should be marked as blocked rather than remaining in progress without context.
Limiting work in progress (WIP) is a key principle in Kanban. When too many tasks are in progress at once, work slows down due to context switching and a lack of focus. Limiting WIP encourages finishing existing tasks before starting new ones and supports a healthier pace of delivery.

## Reflection
Kanban supports prioritisation by making the current state of work visible. It prevents overload because the flow of tasks depends on available capacity rather than assumptions or pressure. This transparency helps teams make better decisions, especially in asynchronous environments.
For my workflow, adopting Kanban principles can help me avoid juggling too many tasks at once. It also encourages consistent updates and clearer communication when something is blocked or needs attention. This improves collaboration and reduces confusion.

## Task Notes
I reviewed the Focus Bear Kanban board to understand how tasks are structured and how they move between stages. Moving a task through the board helped clarify how status updates reflect real progress rather than being a formality.
One improvement I can make is to update task status regularly instead of waiting until completion. This keeps the workflow accurate and helps others understand progress without requiring separate check-ins or explanations.

## Status
Research completed, written reflection saved, and the workflow process has been reviewed and updated accordingly.
