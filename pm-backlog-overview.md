## Understanding How the Backlog Works (Based on Available Access)

Since I currently don’t have full access to Focus Bear’s internal GitHub Projects backlog, this summary is based on standard PM practice, the structure used across my onboarding tasks, and the types of issues referenced in previous discussions (onboarding flows, UX polish, onboarding bugs, etc.).

This provides a realistic understanding of *how* the backlog at Focus Bear most likely works and how items typically move from idea to completion.

## What Is a Product Backlog?

A product backlog is a structured list of everything the team might build — bugs, improvements, feature ideas, user requests, and exploratory tasks.  
Unlike a roadmap, which shows long-term direction, the backlog acts as a **short-term, tactical planning tool** and evolves weekly based on feedback and priorities.

For a startup like Focus Bear, the backlog supports:
- Fast iteration  
- Clear communication between PMs, developers, and designers  
- Prioritisation based on user impact

## Types of Backlog Items (Based on Typical Focus Bear Work)

Even without direct access, the onboarding assignments give a clear picture of the types of items Focus Bear commonly works with.

### 1. Bug Fixes  
These include issues affecting experience or functionality, such as:
- Overlapping UI elements  
- Hidden buttons or cut-off labels  
- Loading issues during onboarding  
Bug items usually get higher priority because they directly block or frustrate users.

### 2. Feature Requests  
Examples inferred from onboarding tasks:
- Adding mascots or onboarding characters  
- Improving time-input selectors  
- Introducing new focus or reminder flows  
Feature requests expand the app's capabilities or improve user motivation.

### 3. UX / UI Improvements  
Common across the app based on screenshots:
- Copy improvements (greetings, clarity, tone)  
- Layout adjustments  
- Onboarding polish or simplification  
These are smaller enhancements that make the product smoother and more accessible, especially for neurodivergent users.

## How Backlog Items Likely Move Through Focus Bear’s Workflow

Based on typical GitHub Projects workflows and how other tasks have been assigned:

### 1. Idea Logged  
A developer, PM, designer, or user surfaces an issue.  
The item is added to GitHub with a short description.

### 2. Clarification / Refinement  
Before development, the PM adds:
- A problem statement  
- User story  
- Acceptance criteria  
- Notes for UX or engineering  

### 3. Prioritisation  
Most likely based on:
- User impact  
- Alignment with OKRs  
- Technical feasibility  
- Urgency based on user feedback (Discord, Zoho Desk)

### 4. In Progress  
Once developers pick up the task, it moves into the appropriate workflow column.  
Questions may arise; PM clarifies as needed.

### 5. QA / Testing  
After development, tasks are tested for:
- Correctness  
- Usability  
- Accessibility (especially important for ADHD/autistic users)

### 6. Done  
The item is closed and may be monitored through analytics and support feedback.

## Reflection

### What I Noticed About the Backlog Structure (Based on Tasks)

The backlog seems heavily focused on:
- Improving onboarding  
- Fixing inconsistencies  
- Enhancing accessibility  
- Addressing user confusion or friction points  
This matches the needs of neurodivergent users who benefit from clear, predictable flows.

### Challenges in Backlog Management  

Common challenges I expect at Focus Bear include:
- Prioritising many small UX issues without losing sight of big features  
- Ensuring acceptance criteria are always clear  
- Coordinating async communication across time zones  
- Managing duplicate user feedback across Discord, email, and testing sessions  

### One Improvement I Would Suggest  

Introduce a consistent template for every backlog item, including:
- Problem  
- User impact  
- Acceptance criteria  
- Dependencies  
- Priority score (e.g., RICE)

This prevents ambiguity and helps developers move faster.

## Summary  

Even without full repo access, it’s clear that Focus Bear’s backlog supports rapid iteration, user-driven improvements, and structured refinement. Understanding how these items evolve from idea → refinement → development helps PMs stay aligned with both user needs and business goals.
