## RICE Scoring Table (Simplified)

| Backlog Item | R | I | C | E (lower = better) | RICE Score |
|--------------|---|---|---|--------------------|------------|
| 1. Preferred name onboarding fix | 500 | 3 | 0.9 | 2 | **675** |
| 2. Time selector UI improvement | 400 | 2 | 0.8 | 3 | **213** |

| 4. Add mascot to onboarding | 500 | 1.5 | 0.7 | 3 | **175** |
| 5. Clarify “Roll Timer” interaction | 350 | 1.5 | 0.7 | 4 | **91** |

*(Higher score = higher priority)*

## Justification (1–2 sentences each)

### 1. **Preferred name onboarding fix** — *RICE: 675*  
This directly affects every new user and shapes their emotional first impression, especially important for neurodivergent users. Effort is low, impact on perceived trust and belonging is high.

### 2. **Time selector UI improvement** — *RICE: 213*  
The current scroll-feel is unintuitive and breaks user flow. Improving this will reduce onboarding friction and make the app feel more polished.

### 3. **Status bar overlap issue** — *RICE: 180*  
Although a small UI defect, it signals poor app stability to users. Fixing it is moderate effort but improves trust and visual clarity.

### 4. **Add mascot to onboarding** — *RICE: 175*  
Brand-aligned visuals can strengthen emotional connection, but this is more of a UX enhancement than a core usability fix. Medium priority.

### 5. **Clarify “Roll Timer” interaction** — *RICE: 91*  
The confusion matters, but it doesn't block users from progressing. This is a meaningful improvement but sits lower compared to issues impacting onboarding identity and clarity.

## Reflection

### Hardest Prioritisation Decision  
Choosing between improving the time selector vs. fixing the status bar was challenging. Both impact first impressions but in different ways — one is interaction-level friction, the other is visual polish. RICE helped quantify the trade-off.

### How Prioritisation Impacts the Team’s Workload  
Clear ranking prevents developers from jumping between tasks based on guesswork. It gives the team a focused sequence, avoids context switching, and keeps engineering efforts aligned with product goals.

### Trade-Offs  
I had to deprioritise cosmetic improvements (e.g., mascot illustration) even though they add personality. The more functional onboarding fixes ranked higher because they solve problems that directly impact user trust and early retention.

---

## Summary
Using RICE clarifies the value vs. effort trade-offs. For Focus Bear, early onboarding clarity clearly carries the highest return. Fixing name personalisation and interaction issues should come before visual polish or optional enhancements.
