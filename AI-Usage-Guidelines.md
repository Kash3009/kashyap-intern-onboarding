# AI Usage Guidelines – Reflection

## Research Summary

As a product management intern, AI tools can be useful for planning, drafting content, analysing feedback, brainstorming ideas, summarising research, and refining communication. Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Notion AI can make work faster and more organised.

AI is helpful, but it comes with risks. The biggest one is leaking confidential or sensitive information such as user data, internal strategy, unreleased features, analytics, or private team discussions. AI models also sometimes produce inaccurate or outdated responses, so everything generated needs review rather than blind trust.

Good use of AI combines efficiency with responsibility: using it to support thinking, not replace it.

## Reflection

### When AI Should Be Used

AI is helpful when:
- Generating ideas or starting points
- Clarifying or rewriting content more clearly
- Organising thoughts, lists, or structures
- Reviewing tone or grammar
- Researching public domain information

### When Not to Use AI

AI shouldn’t be used when:
- The task involves confidential or internal information
- The work requires nuanced judgement without context
- The content is meant to reflect personal experience or decisions

Before submitting anything influenced by AI, reviewing and adjusting it based on my judgement is essential.

## Avoiding Over-Reliance

To avoid depending on AI too heavily, I’ll use it as a helper rather than the decision-maker. I want to develop my own thinking, and AI should only support clarity, speed, or structure—not replace reasoning, product intuition, or communication skills.

## Data Privacy Considerations

To work responsibly, I will avoid entering:
- User data or feedback examples
- Internal messaging or documentation
- Not-yet-released feature information
- Internal strategy, metrics, or anything confidential

If I need to ask about something work-specific, I’ll generalise or anonymise it first.

## Practical Test

I tested using AI for refining a short internal document. The first response was helpful but required edits, tone adjustments, better structure, and removal of assumptions. It was a useful starting point, but still needed my judgement before it was usable.

## Best Practice Moving Forward

**I will always treat AI as a drafting tool, not an authoritative source. Anything generated will be reviewed, edited, and verified before being shared.**
