# Feature One-Pager: Onboarding & Focus Timer UX Improvements

## Feature Name
Onboarding & Focus Timer UX Improvements

---

## Problem Statement
While the Focus Bear app is welcoming and supportive in tone, several UX issues during onboarding and early focus setup create unnecessary friction. These include header truncation due to unsafe padding, inconsistent spacing, and a timer selector that feels static and unclear.

For neurodivergent users (ADHD and Autistic users), predictability, visual clarity, and smooth interaction are critical. Small UX inconsistencies during the first session can increase cognitive load and reduce trust in the product, potentially impacting onboarding completion and early engagement.

## Target Users
- First-time Focus Bear users.
- Neurodivergent users (ADHD, Autism) who benefit from predictable and accessible interfaces.
- Existing users setting up focus sessions, especially in Super Strict Mode.

## User Stories & Scenarios

### User Stories
- As a new user, I want onboarding screens to be visually clear so I can focus on understanding the app instead of interpreting the UI.
- As a user setting up a focus session, I want the timer selector to feel smooth and intuitive so I can confidently choose a duration.
- As a user with ADHD, I want predictable animations and spacing so the interface does not distract or overwhelm me.

### Scenarios
- User logs in for the first time → header text is partially hidden by the system status bar.
- User navigates Home → Overview → Focus → Stats → notices inconsistent spacing and truncated headers.
- User starts a focus session → timer scroll stops mid-motion and shows unclear formatting (e.g., “55..”).
- User enables Super Strict Mode → experiences the same UI issues, indicating they are not mode-specific.
