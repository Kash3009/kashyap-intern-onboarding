## Understanding One-Pagers for Feature Documentation

## What Is a One-Pager in Product Management?
A one-pager is a short, focused document that explains a feature idea clearly enough for teams to align and move forward, without the overhead of a full Product Requirements Document (PRD).

It is typically used early in the product discovery or planning phase to:
- Align developers, designers, and stakeholders quickly
- Validate that everyone understands the problem and proposed solution
- Decide whether a feature should move forward into detailed design or development

A one-pager prioritises clarity and shared understanding over exhaustive detail.

## Key Sections of a Good One-Pager
Based on PM best practices and the example structure used at Focus Bear, a strong one-pager usually includes:

- Feature name  
- Problem statement (what user problem is being solved and why it matters)  
- Target users  
- User stories or scenarios  
- Visuals (wireframes, screenshots, or annotated flows)  
- Acceptance criteria or success indicators  
- Open questions or assumptions  

These sections ensure the document is actionable without becoming overwhelming.

## How PMs Use Visuals in One-Pagers
Visuals are critical because they reduce ambiguity. Screenshots or wireframes:
- Help developers quickly understand layout and interaction expectations
- Allow designers to validate flows early
- Reduce misinterpretation of written requirements
- Speed up discussion by showing rather than describing

Even simple annotated screenshots can be more effective than long explanations.

## One-Pager vs Full PRD
A one-pager is intentionally lightweight. The key differences are:

- A one-pager focuses on *what* and *why*, not every implementation detail.
- A PRD includes deeper technical requirements, edge cases, dependencies, and timelines.
- One-pagers are decision-making tools; PRDs are execution documents.
- One-pagers enable speed and alignment, especially in fast-moving teams like startups.

## Review of the Example One-Pager

### What the One-Pager Covered Well
The example one-pager clearly explained:
- The core user problem
- The intended feature outcome
- A basic user flow supported by visuals
- Why the feature mattered from a user perspective

This made it easy to understand the purpose of the feature without needing additional context.

### Missing or Unclear Details
Some areas could be improved:
- Acceptance criteria were high-level and not always testable
- Edge cases were not explicitly mentioned
- Success metrics were not clearly defined
- A short “out of scope” section could have prevented misinterpretation

---

## How the One-Pager Could Be Improved
- Add clearer acceptance criteria so developers know when the feature is “done”
- Explicitly list assumptions and open questions
- Include a small note on how success will be measured
- Clarify any constraints (technical, UX, or timeline-related)

These additions would increase clarity without turning the document into a full PRD.

## Reflection

### How a One-Pager Balances Clarity with Brevity
A one-pager works because it forces prioritisation. Only the most important information is included, which keeps discussions focused and prevents over-engineering early ideas.

### Most Critical Sections
The most critical sections are:
- Problem statement
- User story or scenario
- Visual representation
- Acceptance criteria

Without these, the document risks being vague or open to interpretation.

### One Thing I Would Change in the Example
I would strengthen the acceptance criteria by making them more specific and testable. This would reduce follow-up questions and help the feature move more smoothly into development.

## Summary
One-pagers are effective because they provide fast alignment while keeping teams flexible. At Focus Bear, they are especially useful for balancing speed, clarity, and collaboration across a remote, async-friendly environment.
