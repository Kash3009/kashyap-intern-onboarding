# PM Decision-Making  

## Understanding Feature Prioritisation

Feature prioritisation is the process of deciding which ideas become roadmap items, which get postponed, and which never get built. A Product Manager needs to balance user value, technical feasibility, timeline, and business direction — not just what sounds exciting.

Some common prioritisation frameworks PMs use include:

- **RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort):** Helps estimate the value of a feature versus the cost to build it.
- **MoSCoW (Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Won’t-Have):** Useful when aligning teams quickly around what is essential.
- **Kano Model:** Categorises features based on how they affect user satisfaction (basic needs, performance, or delighters).
- **Opportunity Scoring / Jobs-to-be-Done:** Focuses on solving the most painful or valuable user outcomes rather than building more features.

No framework is perfect. They’re tools to guide structured thinking, not rigid formulas.

## Balancing Trade-offs

Every product decision involves trade-offs. PMs rarely get perfect alignment across:

- **User Needs:** What users want or what will meaningfully solve a real problem.
- **Technical Feasibility:** Whether the engineering team can build it with available time, skills, and infrastructure.
- **Business Impact:** Whether the feature drives revenue, retention, engagement, or strategic differentiation.

A PM’s job is to make decisions that move the product forward without overwhelming engineering, confusing users, or scattering focus.

## Deciding What Not to Build

Sometimes the most important decision is choosing *not* to build something. Reasons may include:

- The request solves a niche problem for a tiny percentage of users.
- It creates unnecessary complexity in the experience.
- It doesn’t align with the product’s core identity or mission.
- The opportunity cost is too high compared to more impactful priorities.

Saying “no” helps maintain product clarity and avoid feature bloat.

## Reflection Scenarios

### 1. If users request a new feature, but it’s costly to develop, how would I approach it?

I would start by understanding the underlying problem:  
Are users requesting this because something in the current UX isn’t working, or is it a true gap worth solving?

Then I’d evaluate:

- How many users requested it?
- How important is the problem it solves?
- Is there a simpler or incremental version we could release first?

If the feature genuinely creates value but is expensive, I’d consider alternatives like:

- releasing a lightweight MVP version,
- bundling it with another strategic initiative,
- or delaying until it aligns with roadmap capacity.

### 2. If engineers say a feature will take three months instead of one month, what would I do?

My first step would be to understand **why**:

- Is the design unclear?
- Is there technical debt?
- Are we underestimating backend or edge cases?

From there, I'd explore options:

- simplify scope,
- break the feature into smaller releases,
- or adjust timeline expectations.

This conversation should be collaborative — not a negotiation battle.

### 3. Why is saying “no” sometimes the best decision?

Because every “yes” has an invisible cost.  
Yes to one feature may mean:

- delayed releases,
- slower product experience,
- increased support complexity,
- or distraction from what matters most.

Saying “no” protects product clarity, engineering focus, and user experience.

## Final Thoughts

Decision-making as a PM is rarely about choosing the feature with the most votes. It’s about understanding the problem deeply, considering timing and trade-offs, and ensuring progress aligns with the product’s long-term purpose.

Great PM decisions feel thoughtful and intentional — not rushed or reactive — and they help the team move confidently in the right direction.
