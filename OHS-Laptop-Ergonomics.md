# Occupational Health & Safety: Laptop Ergonomics

## Research Summary

Working long hours on a laptop without proper ergonomic adjustments can lead to neck strain, back pain, wrist tension, and eye fatigue. The main cause is the screen sitting too low and the keyboard being too close to the body, which encourages hunching and awkward wrist angles.

Ergonomic improvements such as a laptop stand, an external keyboard, or an adjustable office chair help create a more neutral posture. Ideally, the top of the screen should sit at eye level, feet should be flat on the floor, and arms should rest comfortably at a 90-degree angle.

Daily habits also play an important role. Short breaks every 25-50 minutes, posture checks, stretching, and reducing continuous screen focus (e.g., 20-20-20 rule) help reduce strain and improve long-term comfort.

## Reflection

### Workspace Improvements I Can Make

I noticed that my laptop currently sits too low, which makes me tilt my head down. To improve this, I plan to use a laptop stand so the screen sits closer to eye level. Pairing it with an external keyboard and mouse will let me keep a neutral arm position while typing.

### Behavioural Changes

I tend to work for long stretches without moving, especially when I’m focused. To reduce stiffness, I want to take short movement breaks and stretch my shoulders and wrists regularly. Maintaining an upright posture with my back supported will also help prevent discomfort.

### Reminders and Consistency

To make these habits stick, I’ll use Focus Bear reminders for posture checks and movement breaks. Having structured nudges will make it easier to turn proper ergonomics into a routine instead of something I only remember occasionally.

## Action Taken

- Raised laptop height using a temporary stand  
- Started using an external mouse  
- Enabled Focus Bear movement reminders  
- Performed posture checks throughout one workday  

These small changes already made working feel more comfortable and reduced neck tension.
