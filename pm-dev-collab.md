## Challenges Developers Face When Working with PMs
From general PM practice and discussions during onboarding, developers often face these challenges when working with PMs:
- Vague or incomplete requirements that require back-and-forth clarification
- Changing priorities without clear reasoning or context
- Lack of clarity around what is “must-have” vs “nice-to-have”
- Feature specs that explain *what* to build but not *why* it matters

These issues can slow development and create frustration, especially in fast-moving startup environments.

## Clarifying Feature Requirements for Engineers
The most effective ways PMs clarify requirements include:
- Writing clear problem statements before proposing solutions
- Using acceptance criteria that are specific and testable
- Including visuals (screenshots, wireframes) to remove ambiguity
- Clearly stating assumptions, constraints, and out-of-scope items
- Being available to answer questions quickly in async workflows

Clear documentation combined with open communication prevents misinterpretation.

## Handling Technical Constraints & Trade-Offs
PMs and developers collaborate by:
- Discussing feasibility early before committing to scope
- Exploring alternative solutions when implementation cost is high
- Agreeing on phased delivery instead of all-or-nothing features
- Prioritising user impact over perfection when time or resources are limited

A good PM respects technical input and adapts plans accordingly.

## Task: Developer Perspective (Based on Available Conversations)

*(Note: Due to limited direct access, insights below are based on onboarding discussions, common developer feedback patterns, and observed collaboration practices.)*

### What Makes Working with PMs Easier
Developers appreciate PMs who:
- Provide clear acceptance criteria
- Explain the user problem behind the request
- Respond quickly to questions
- Make decisions when trade-offs are needed

### What Frustrates Developers About PMs
Common frustrations include:
- Unclear or constantly changing requirements
- Lack of prioritisation clarity
- Specs that are too high-level or overly detailed without focus
- Late-stage changes after implementation has started

---

## Feature Spec Improvement for Engineers
One improvement that would help developers work more efficiently is:
- Adding a clear **Definition of Done** to every feature spec, including acceptance criteria, edge cases, and validation steps.

This reduces guesswork and ensures everyone agrees on when a task is complete.

## Reflection

### What I Learned
The biggest takeaway is that developers value clarity and context more than volume. A well-written, focused spec saves time and reduces friction far more than long explanations.

### Preventing Miscommunication
PMs can prevent miscommunication by:
- Aligning early on scope and priorities
- Using visuals to support written requirements
- Keeping documentation updated as decisions change
- Treating feature specs as collaboration tools, not instructions

### One Change I’d Make to Feature Documentation
I would standardise a lightweight template across all specs that includes:
- Problem statement
- User impact
- Acceptance criteria
- Out-of-scope notes

This would make it easier for developers to quickly understand and execute work.

## Summary
Strong PM–developer collaboration is built on trust, clarity, and responsiveness. By respecting technical constraints and communicating clearly, PMs help developers focus on delivering high-quality solutions that align with user and business goals.
