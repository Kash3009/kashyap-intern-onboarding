# Product Management at Focus Bear  

## Initial Understanding of Product Priorities

Based on my review of the app, public-facing content, and onboarding material, Focus Bear’s current priorities appear to be:

1. Improving the **first-time user experience** so new users understand the app faster and feel supported instead of overwhelmed.
2. Strengthening **habit consistency features**, such as clearer routines, better progress tracking, and behaviour reinforcement.
3. Reducing **friction and confusion points** within navigation, UI layout, and onboarding flow — especially considering the neurodivergent audience.
4. Ensuring **cross-device integration** remains seamless, since users move between desktop and mobile during their day.

I’ll refine these once I attend OKRs and conversations with the team.

## Key User Problems Focus Bear Is Solving

From exploring the app and reviewing the mission, Focus Bear exists to help users who struggle with:

- Starting tasks even when they know what needs to be done.
- Staying on track and avoiding distractions (especially digital).
- Maintaining routines like morning habits, break reminders, and healthier pacing throughout the day.
- Avoiding burnout caused by cycles of high productivity followed by exhaustion.

The product isn’t just providing focus tools — it’s trying to help users build **consistency, structure, and emotional safety** around their daily routines.

## How Focus Bear Collects and Uses User Feedback (Initial Understanding)

Based on what I’ve seen so far, feedback seems to come from:

- App usage behaviour and analytics
- Direct in-app or form-based reports
- Community discussions (e.g., Discord)
- Internal testing and QA
- User testing session recordings

It appears user insights directly inform prioritisation and iteration, especially when confusion, accessibility issues, or workflow-blocking problems are identified.

## Collaboration Model Between Roles

From early observations, product management at Focus Bear seems collaborative and iterative:

| Role | Interaction with PM |
|------|---------------------|
| Developers | PM provides requirements and priorities, clarifies behaviour expected, helps unblock questions |
| UX Designers | PM collaborates on clarity, accessibility, emotional experience, and problem definition |
| QA | PM helps validate acceptance criteria and clarify expected behaviour |
| Users | PM collects insights, identifies patterns, and turns them into improvements |

I'll refine this once I observe actual workflows in meetings.

## Planned Tasks

- Attend two OKR meetings and take structured notes.
- Review recent user testing recordings.
- Document:
  - Three user frustrations or confusion points  
  - Three things that worked well
- Identify at least one product area that feels unclear or underperforming and form one strategic question to bring into the next meeting.

(These sections will be updated after I gather the required material.)

## Early Observations and Potential Opportunities

Based on the app walkthrough so far, one area that stands out is **first-time onboarding clarity**. There are moments where UI elements are cut off, unclear, or visually overwhelming — especially for users already struggling with executive dysfunction.

My early question for the team:

> “Are we currently measuring where users drop off during the onboarding flow, and if so, which step has the highest friction?”

## Reflection: Current Product Challenges

These are early guesses that I expect to validate:

1. **Clarity vs Feature Depth**  
   The app already does many things (focus blocking, habits, movement reminders, routines), but new users may not fully understand the system quickly.

2. **Accessibility for Neurodivergent Audiences**  
   ADHD/ASD users need clarity, predictability, and low cognitive load — even small UI inconsistencies can disrupt the experience.

3. **Behaviour Change Consistency**  
   Helping users not just start but *stick to habits long term* is one of the hardest behavioural design challenges in any productivity product.

## Questions I Still Have

- What drives prioritisation today: user demand, strategic direction, business metrics, or technical constraints?
- What does success look like for Focus Bear over the next 6–12 months?
- Which product bets are currently considered “non-negotiable,” and which are experimental?
- How do we measure the emotional impact of the product (stress reduction, confidence, motivation)?

## Closing Note

This document is a starting point. As I attend meetings, review data, and collaborate with the team, I’ll continue refining it into something more detailed, strategic, and actionable — aligned fully with Focus Bear’s product direction and priorities.
