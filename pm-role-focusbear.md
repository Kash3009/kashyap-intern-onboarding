# PM Role Reflection  


## What Does a Product Manager Do?

A Product Manager sits at the intersection of **user needs**, **business priorities**, and **technical feasibility**. They guide the product forward — not by building it themselves, but by ensuring the right things are being built for the right reasons at the right time.

Some of the key responsibilities of a PM include:

- Defining product strategy and roadmap aligned with company goals.
- Understanding user needs through research, interviews, and testing.
- Prioritising features and managing the backlog.
- Working closely with engineering, design, marketing, and support to move ideas to execution.
- Measuring success through metrics, feedback, retention data, and iteration.

A large part of the role is communication — making sure everyone is aligned on what’s happening, why it matters, and how progress will be delivered.

## Common Misconceptions About PMs

One common misconception is that PMs “tell everyone what to do.” In reality, a PM doesn’t *command* — they **align, facilitate, and enable**. Another misconception is that PMs must have all the answers. Often the job isn’t knowing the answer — it’s knowing the right questions, getting clarity, and guiding the team toward thoughtful decisions.

A third misconception is that PMs only work at a big-picture level. In a startup like Focus Bear, the role is hands-on: writing specs, testing features, jumping into support tickets, documenting insights, and helping wherever momentum is needed.

## How PMs Collaborate with the Team

A PM works differently with each function:

- **Engineers:** Ensure clarity on requirements, discuss feasibility trade-offs, and refine solutions to avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Designers/UX:** Explore user problems, shape user flows, and validate whether solutions are intuitive and accessible.
- **Marketing:** Understand how features will be positioned, communicated, and launched in a way that supports growth and user education.
- **Customer Support & Community:** Listen to real-world feedback, bug reports, and emerging trends.

The PM acts as the connector across these groups — making sure discussions lead to decisions and decisions lead to progress.

## What Makes a PM Successful at Focus Bear?

Based on how Focus Bear operates, the most important traits appear to be:

- **Empathy:** Understanding the challenges of neurodivergent users and advocating for accessibility and clarity in every decision.
- **Curiosity:** Asking good questions, exploring why users behave the way they do, and looking beyond assumptions.
- **Adaptability:** Things move fast in startups — priorities shift, experiments fail, and ideas evolve. A strong PM adjusts without losing direction.
- **Execution discipline:** Ideas are valuable, but delivering meaningful improvements consistently is what moves the product forward.

## Reflection

### The Three Most Important Responsibilities (in my words)
1. Making sure the product solves meaningful user problems and stays aligned with the mission.
2. Prioritising work thoughtfully so the team builds what matters most.
3. Facilitating communication and alignment across engineering, design, and leadership.

### Something That Surprised Me About the Role

I always thought PMs mostly created roadmaps and strategy. What surprised me is how operational and hands-on the day-to-day work can be — from user testing, writing specs, reviewing analytics, to answering support questions. It’s a balance of strategy and execution, not just one or the other.

### Biggest Challenges for PMs at Focus Bear

Based on my onboarding so far, a few unique challenges stand out:

- Balancing a lot of feature requests with a small, focused team.
- Designing for neurodivergent users — where small design decisions can significantly impact usability.
- Maintaining clarity and alignment in an async-first, remote environment.

## Final Thoughts

The PM role at Focus Bear is meaningful because it connects the mission, helping neurodivergent users thrive, to real product decisions. It requires empathy, structured thinking, and a willingness to iterate constantly. It feels like a role where learning never stops, and that’s exactly what makes it motivating.
