# Competitive Landscape – Focus Bear vs Other Apps

## Apps considered

- Freedom – distraction blocker across devices  
- Cold Turkey Blocker – strict website and app blocker (mainly desktop)  
- Tiimo – visual planner designed for ADHD and neurodivergent users  
- Routinery – routine / habit timer for building consistent daily habits

## 1. Quick overview of each app

### Freedom

- Core value: blocks distracting websites and apps across multiple devices on a schedule.
- Typical use case: knowledge workers who want to cut down social media, news and other distractions while working.
- Strengths:
  - Multi-device sessions (phone, tablet, computer).
  - Flexible blocklists and scheduled focus sessions.
  - Emphasis on self-control without changing the rest of your workflow.

### Cold Turkey Blocker

- Core value: very strict, hard-to-bypass blocking on desktop.
- Typical use case: people who know they will override weak blockers and want something “unbreakable.”
- Strengths:
  - Powerful website and app blocking, including whole-internet blocks.
  - “Lock mode” that cannot be disabled until the timer ends.
  - Highly customisable schedules for work vs rest time.

### Tiimo

- Core value: an ADHD-friendly visual planner that turns the calendar into simple, coloured routines.
- Typical use case: neurodivergent users who need visual structure across day, week and month.
- Strengths:
  - Visual timelines, widgets and watch integration.
  - Gentle reminders and checklists rather than “hard” blocking.
  - Strong branding around ADHD, autism and executive-function support.

### Routinery

- Core value: a behavioural-science-based routine and habit timer.
- Typical use case: users who want help turning fixed routines (morning, study block, evening wind-down) into repeatable flows.
- Strengths:
  - Step-by-step routine timers with progress visuals.
  - Analytics around completion and consistency.
  - Focus on habit formation rather than pure distraction blocking.

## 2. Where Focus Bear fits

From what I’ve seen in the app and onboarding, Focus Bear sits at the intersection of:

- **Distraction blocking** – similar to Freedom / Cold Turkey (blocking permissions, “super strict mode”).  
- **Routine and habit support** – similar to Tiimo / Routinery (morning / evening routines, tasks, stats).  
- **Neurodivergent support** – explicitly designed for people with ADHD, autism and executive-function challenges.

So instead of being only a blocker *or* only a planner, Focus Bear tries to be a:

> “Daily operating system for focus, habits and healthier screen use,” especially for neurodivergent users.

## 3. What makes Focus Bear different?

### 3.1 Integrated routines + blocking

- Freedom and Cold Turkey focus almost entirely on blocking.  
- Tiimo and Routinery focus on planning and routines without hard blocking.  

Focus Bear combines both:

- Routines and tasks (e.g. “Evening Routine”, “Top Tasks”)  
- Plus distraction blocking tied to those focus sessions.

That means the user journey is not just “block social media” but:

1. Decide what to work on.  
2. Start a focus session with a timer.  
3. Have distractions blocked during that session.  
4. See stats later in the “Stats / Health” area.

This integrated flow is the main differentiator vs single-purpose tools.

### 3.2 Stronger positioning around ADHD / vulnerable populations

Tiimo and Routinery are already ADHD-friendly, but Focus Bear leans even harder into:

- Executive-function support (routines, prompts, time logs).  
- Policies about working with vulnerable populations.  
- An onboarding program that trains interns to think ethically about neurodivergent users.

This makes Focus Bear not just a generic productivity app, but a *mission-driven* tool with a clear audience.

### 3.3 Behavioural nudges, not just “lock everything”

Compared to Cold Turkey’s “unbreakable” mode, Focus Bear feels more like:

- “Let’s help you build better habits and reduce low-quality screen time,”  
  rather than “Lock yourself out of your computer and suffer.”

This tone should appeal to users who want structure and support without feeling punished.

## 4. If I were a user, why choose Focus Bear?

If I imagine myself as a typical user (student / knowledge worker with ADHD tendencies), I would choose Focus Bear over the others when:

1. **I want an all-in-one routine + focus system.**  
   - Freedom / Cold Turkey would still require a separate planner or habit app.  
   - Tiimo / Routinery would still leave me exposed to distractions.  
   - Focus Bear gives me routines, tasks, blocking and stats in one place.

2. **I care about long-term behaviour change, not just “survival mode” blocking.**  
   - Cold Turkey is great for emergency blocking, but doesn’t really teach better habits.  
   - Focus Bear encourages reflection (e.g. time logs, screen-time stats, routines), which supports long-term change.

3. **I identify with the neurodivergent audience.**  
   - Focus Bear’s routines, language and policies openly acknowledge ADHD/autism.  
   - That makes it feel safer and more tailored than generic blockers.

4. **I like a warm, character-driven brand.**  
   - The bear theme, stats around “good vs bad screen time,” and tone of prompts are more friendly than typical blocker apps.

## 5. One feature competitors have that Focus Bear doesn’t

There are a few stand-out features from competitors that Focus Bear currently doesn’t match:

- **Freedom: highly polished multi-device control from a single dashboard**  
  - Start one session and it automatically syncs across all devices.  
- **Cold Turkey: ultra-strict lock mode and “block the entire internet” option**  
  - Very useful when someone wants zero chance to cheat on desktop.  
- **Tiimo: deep watch and widget integration for micro-reminders**  
  - The ability to see and tick off tasks on a watch without unlocking the phone.  
- **Routinery: strong analytics around routine completion and habit consistency**  
  - Detailed graphs and streaks focused on habit formation.

If I have to pick *one* concrete feature:  

> **Tiimo-style watch and widget integration for routines and timers.**

For neurodivergent users, being able to follow routines from a watch (without opening the phone and getting distracted) is extremely valuable. It reduces friction and cognitive load.

## 6. One improvement suggestion for Focus Bear

Based on both the competitor research and my own first-time experience in the app, my main improvement suggestion is:

### Add “low-friction reminders and controls outside the app” (widgets / watch / notifications)

**Why this matters**

- Neurodivergent users often get lost between intention and action.  
- Every extra tap (unlock phone → find app → open → start session) is another chance to get distracted.  
- Tiimo and Routinery reduce that friction with widgets, watch apps and very lightweight prompts.

**What this could look like for Focus Bear**

- A simple home-screen widget / watch tile that lets users:
  - Start a focus session with one tap (using their usual preset duration).  
  - See the current routine step or next habit.  
  - Quickly mark a task as done without opening the full app.
- Optional subtle notifications:
  - “You planned to start your Evening Routine now – start focus session?”  
  - “You’re 10 minutes into doom-scrolling, want to switch to your planned task?”

**How this connects back to the mission**

- Keeps the “kind helper” personality of Focus Bear rather than becoming a harsh blocker.  
- Supports ADHD users in the exact moment they are most likely to drift away from their plans.  
- Differentiates Focus Bear even more from pure blockers (Freedom / Cold Turkey) and pure planners (Tiimo / Routinery).

---

## 7. Summary

- Freedom and Cold Turkey are excellent at **hard blocking**, but rely on other tools for planning and habits.  
- Tiimo and Routinery are excellent at **visual planning and routines**, but don’t fully protect against distractions.  
- Focus Bear’s strength is in combining **routines, blocking and neurodivergent-focused design** into a single system.

If Focus Bear continues to:

1. Integrate blocking tightly with routines and stats, and  
2. Reduce friction with lighter-weight controls outside the app,

it can occupy a very defensible position as the go-to “focus operating system” for ADHD and other vulnerable users, rather than just another blocker or habit tracker.
