## Handling Scope Changes & Trade-Offs at Focus Bear

## Research & Learn

### Why Feature Scope Changes During Development
Feature scope often changes for a few common reasons:
- New technical constraints are discovered after implementation begins
- Initial assumptions about effort or complexity turn out to be incorrect
- User feedback reveals that part of the feature is confusing or unnecessary
- Time or resource constraints force reprioritisation
- Dependencies on other systems or features cause delays

In startups like Focus Bear, scope changes are especially common because learning happens continuously, not just upfront.

### Handling Pushback from Engineers
When engineers push back on feasibility, effective PMs:
- Ask clarifying questions to understand the real constraint
- Separate “hard blockers” from “nice-to-haves”
- Explore alternative solutions that still meet the user goal
- Reframe the problem instead of defending a specific implementation

Pushback is usually a signal to collaborate more closely, not a conflict.

---

### Delay vs. Reduced Scope
It’s usually better to ship a **reduced but valuable version** when:
- The core user problem can still be solved
- The feature provides learning or feedback
- Delay would block other work or momentum

Delaying is better when:
- Quality or trust would be compromised
- Partial delivery creates confusion
- The feature is tightly coupled to other unfinished work

## Task

### Example of Scope Change (Observed / Hypothetical Based on App Experience)

**Feature area:** Onboarding and focus session controls

**What changed and why:**  
Based on observing the Focus Bear app, certain UI elements (such as timers, headers, and status indicators) appear simplified, with some advanced controls hidden or deferred. This suggests a likely scope decision to prioritise core functionality over detailed customisation during early releases.

**How the decision was likely made:**  
The team likely chose to:
- Prioritise a working, stable focus flow
- Reduce complexity for first-time users
- Avoid overloading users with too many controls
- Ship faster and learn from real usage rather than over-design upfront

**What could have been done differently:**  
- Flag deferred enhancements clearly in the backlog
- Communicate future improvements to users
- Add lightweight tooltips or explanations for simplified behaviour

This approach would maintain clarity while still managing scope responsibly.

## Reflection

### Strategy for Handling Last-Minute Scope Changes
One effective strategy is to **re-anchor the conversation to the user outcome**, not the feature itself. Asking “What problem must still be solved for this release?” helps teams cut scope without losing value.

---

### Balancing User Needs and Technical Constraints
PMs balance this by:
- Understanding technical constraints early
- Involving engineers in solution design, not just delivery
- Prioritising impact over completeness
- Being transparent about trade-offs with stakeholders

The goal isn’t perfection — it’s progress without harming trust.

---

### When to Push Back vs. Compromise
A PM should **push back** when:
- Scope cuts undermine the core user value
- Decisions compromise usability or accessibility
- Shortcuts introduce long-term technical debt without justification

A PM should **compromise** when:
- The reduced scope still delivers meaningful value
- Time or resource constraints are real
- The feature can be improved iteratively post-release

Good PMs know the difference and explain it clearly.

## Summary
Handling scope changes is not about saying yes or no — it’s about making thoughtful trade-offs. At Focus Bear, where user trust and accessibility matter deeply, PMs must balance speed with care. Clear communication, empathy for technical constraints, and a strong focus on user outcomes are what make scope decisions successful.
