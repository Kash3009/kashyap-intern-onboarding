# Cyber Security Guidelines – Reflection

## Key Learnings

Remote work environments face several cybersecurity threats such as phishing attempts, weak passwords, unsecured networks, malware, and unauthorised account access. Because we work digitally and rely on cloud-based tools, staying secure depends on individual habits, not just software.
Keeping devices and accounts secure involves using strong passwords, storing them safely, enabling two-factor authentication, updating software regularly, locking devices when away, and being cautious with suspicious links or messages. These practices help prevent accidental data leaks or unauthorised access.
A strong password should be long, unique, and difficult to guess. Using a password manager makes it easier to manage complex passwords without repeating them across services.

## Reflection

Currently, I already use biometrics on my devices and avoid accessing work accounts on public Wi-Fi without a VPN. I’ve also been careful about phishing attempts and verifying links before clicking.
Where I can improve is consistency. Sometimes security habits only happen when something reminds me, rather than automatically. I want to make secure behaviour part of my workflow — not something I only think about after the fact.
One step I’ll take is enabling 2FA on all accounts where it’s supported, not just the main ones. I’ll also ensure my passwords are stored only in an encrypted password manager instead of scattered across devices or browsers.
If I ever notice suspicious activity or something feels “off”, my first action will be to report it immediately instead of trying to fix it myself. Quick reporting reduces damage and ensures the situation is handled correctly.

## Action Taken

- Enabled two-factor authentication for relevant work and personal accounts  
- Updated weaker passwords and stored them in a password manager  
- Set laptop and phone to auto-lock after short inactivity  
- Reviewed how I handle links, attachments, and unknown contacts

## New Cyber Security Habit

Going forward, I will regularly check and update my security settings, and avoid reusing passwords across platforms. I will also make a habit of locking my device any time I step away — even for a short moment. These small actions build long-term security and help protect both company data and user privacy.
